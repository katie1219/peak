## Inspiration
### Peak
Our group came up with the project **Peak** when one of the group members
interested to keep up with healthy diets during the pandemic. However,
she realized it was hard to keep motivated to catch up on the diet
schedule when doing alone. She wants to find a community to support her.


## What it does
Our Peak website consisted of three main features. The first feature
helps users to **find the community they are interested in**. Such
community includes:
1. Vegan
2. Plant lovers
3. Vegetarian
4. Practice recycling
5. Reduce emissions
6. Waste reduction
7. Reduce water pollution
8. Water treatment

After joining a community, users could **browse preset goals** they
wanted to finish. Users could also **engage with community members**
through *sharing* their own progress and *commenting* and *checking*
on each others' goal-achieving progress.

## How we built it
We started by doing **online research** which all of our members contribute.
We first build the **lo-fi** prototype and **hi-fi** prototype in the design
phase. After finishing the prototype, we have **front-end** and **back-end**
developed at the same time.


## Challenges we ran into
We have three designers and one developer in our group which made
the developer more work on the back-end. Luckily, all the designers
have some knowledge in the front-end so that eases up the work.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are able to collaborate *across different time zones* since one
of the members is in Taiwan and the other three are in the US.
Some went to rest while others went to work due to time differences.

## What we learned
Sprint design and fast pace coding as two of the designers are not
super familiar with front-end.


## What's next for Peak
Hopefully, we could really publish this site and help people achieve
their goals. We are also hoping the accessibility of this site could
reach the people who have limited access to health and sustainable
resources as our site could also serve as providing tips to be
more sustainable and healthy. People out there alone trying to
accomplish the goals could find a community to support them.
